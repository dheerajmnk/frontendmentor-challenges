### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In order to complete this project, I learnt about Flexbox and Grid from Web Dev Simplified. 

This was the property used to create 3 column grids:

```css
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
```

By removing 2 out of 3 fractions in my media query for mobile design, I was able to change my 3 columns into 3 rows:

```css
grid-template-columns: 1fr;
```
